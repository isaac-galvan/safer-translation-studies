# Safer Illinois Github Introduction for Translation Studies

An introduction to the Safer Illinois repository and how to contribute to the project.

## Safer Illinois is Open Source

From [opensource.com](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source):

>
> The term open source refers to something people can modify and share because its design is publicly accessible.
>

All of the code, assets, strings, and images can be viewed and modified by anyone at our [Github repo](https://github.com/rokwire/safer-illinois-app).

### Why are we open source?

Some of the many reasons we've gone open source:

* **Transparency**: anyone can review the code to find errors of inconsistencies
* **Adoption and remixing**: anyone can modify and improve the code or adopt portions of it into their own projects
* **Support Innovation**: Rokwire project is releasing apps and building block for anyone to build a smart, healthy community.

### Why would you contribute to open source?

Contributing to open source projects is a great way to learn to code.  People getting started in development can review code for many established and stable software projects.

Contributing isn't just coding though! 
Other ways to participate include:
* reporting bugs
* contributing feature requests
* writing documentation
* providing translations
* helping on websites and promotions

Open source contributions are great resume builders and let an employer preview your coding or documentation style and your ability to work with diverse teams through constructive feedback.



## Changes incoming!

We use git and Github to track Safer Illinois changes and contributors.

Git is a version control system that takes snapshots of the project in development. Using git, a contributor can copy the project, make modifications, and then submit them to be merged into the master. 

Git is distributed, so several contributors can make edits at the same time and conflicts introduced can be settled when the changed are merged.

Github is a web-based collection of tools to work with a git repository.
